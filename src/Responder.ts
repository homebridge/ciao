    //    for which it is currently authoritative, and it receives a Multicast
    //    DNS response message containing a record with the same name, rrtype
    //    and rrclass, but inconsistent rdata.  What may be considered
    //    inconsistent is context-sensitive, except that resource records with
    //    identical rdata are never considered inconsistent, even if they
    //    originate from different hosts.  This is to permit use of proxies and
    //    other fault-tolerance mechanisms that may cause more than one
    //    responder to be capable of issuing identical answers on the network.
    //
    //    A common example of a resource record type that is intended to be
    //    unique, not shared between hosts, is the address record that maps a
    //    host's name to its IP address.  Should a host witness another host
    //    announce an address record with the same name but a different IP
    //    address, then that is considered inconsistent, and that address
    //    record is considered to be in conflict.
    //
    //    Whenever a Multicast DNS responder receives any Multicast DNS
    //    response (solicited or otherwise) containing a conflicting resource
    //    record in any of the Resource Record Sections, the Multicast DNS
    //    responder MUST immediately reset its conflicted unique record to
    //    probing state, and go through the startup steps described above in
    //    Section 8, "Probing and Announcing on Startup".  The protocol used in
